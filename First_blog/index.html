            <h3>Step By Step Preperation Of Tom Brown Powder</h3>   

            <ol>
                <li>Put your grains in separate trays and carefully remove the stones and foreign particles</li>
                <li>After picking out the stones from your grains, wash them separately and spread them out to dry in the sun.</li>
                <li>Pack them in separate bowls once they are completely dry.</li>
                <li>Toast your corn using a wide frying pan. Be careful not to fry too much to a point where it begins to pop like popcorn.</li>
                <li>Also roast your groundnut, millet and soya beans separately till they become golden brown.</li>
                <li>After toasting, spread your grains and allow them to cool down.</li>
                <li>The next step is to remove the outer shell/ seed coat (also known as chaff) of the soya beans. You can do this by grinding it softy with a mortar and pestle.</li>
                <li>When you are done grinding, sift the chaff away by breezing it out. Then pour it into a suitable bowl.</li>
                <li>Next thing is to grind your crayfish, ginger and kayan kanshi. You can either use a mortar and pestle for this or you use a blender. Put it inside a bowl after grinding.</li>
                <li>Now, you need to grind your dates (dabino) as well. Break them open and remove and discard the seeds inside first. Then crush the outer fruit with a blender or mortar and pestle.</li>
                <li>Pour all your ingredients in a bowl and mix them well.</li>
                <li>You can blend this mixture with a high power blender at home or you you take it to a local mill to blend. Do not add water while blending.</li>
                <li>After blending, pour your powder on a wide tray and allow it to cool down completely.</li>
                <li>Next thing is to sieve your mixture to remove any residual chaff. This leaves you with a smoother powder.</li>
                <li>Viola! Your tom brown is ready. Just store it inside a sizeable container and prepare it anytime you want.</li>
